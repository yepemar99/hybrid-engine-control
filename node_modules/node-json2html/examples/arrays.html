    //In this example we'll show you how you can map data directly to a template
    // plus show you how to work with arrays of literals (like strings) instead of objects

	//Data that we want to render
    const employees = [
    	{"name":"Jenny Brown","role":"CEO","management":true,"access":["hr","finance","technical"]},
    	{"name":"Ashley White","role":"CFO","management":true,"access":["hr","finance"]},

				//Span element with special logic for the class property
				{"<>":"span","class":o=>{
				    
				    //If the user is part of managemnt then put them in blue
				    if(o.management) return("text-red-600"); 
					else return("text-pink-600");
				    
				},"text":"${name} - ${role}"},
				
				//List the access that each employee has
				{"<>":"ul","class":"ml-5 italic text-gray-500","html":[
				    
				    //We can list all the access by simply mapping the access array (using the reserved {} attribute) to the li element
				    // this will repeat an li element for every value in the array
				    // NOTE the {} reserved attribute needs to be a function that returns the data you wish to map
				    //  this also works for components! But we'll get to this later
				    {"<>":"li","{}":o=>o.access,"text":"${value}"}

    //Render the list of employees using jquery 
    // note we can also do this using json2html.render as we don't have any events
